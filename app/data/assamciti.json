      "The people in Assam have since long faced the problem of illegal migrants from various countries sharing the eastern borders of our nation and especially Bangladesh. The Citizenship Amendment Bill has not been sitting well with the Assamese as it contradicts the Assam Accord of 1985, which clearly states that illegal migrants heading in from Bangladesh after March 25, 1971, would be deported.Over the years, certain exceptions have been made to this law. In September 2015, illegal migrants belonging to minority communities in Afghanistan, Bangladesh or Pakistan and coming to India on or before December 31, 2014, were allowed to stay. This allowed the illegal migrants to stay in India without being imprisoned or deported. This exception was sought again in July this year. The illegal migrants are most likely to settle in the state of Assam and that does not go well with the administration of the state as well as its people.\nThe resources are already under pressure due to the rapid influx of people into the cities and towns. Additional population will not only burden the resources but also have adverse societal impacts and may lead to effective communal divide. However, even the states opposing the Bill are not united on their stance. The two major valleys Brahmaputra Valley and Barak Valley in Assam are of unlike opinions on the bill. While protestors in Brahmaputra valley took out processions carrying banners that opposed the Bill, hundreds lined the streets of Silchar holding placards supporting ‘unconditional citizenship to persecuted minorities in Bangladesh’. The 16-member committee, headed by BJP MP Rajendra Agrawal, met 112 organisations in Silchar on Tuesday, 86 from Karimganj and 26 from Hailakandi, besides a number of individuals. They are expected to meet another 153 organisations from Cachar on Wednesday before deciding on a report to be presented before Parliament on the Bill that seeks to grant citizenship to religious minorities from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan facing persecution and violence for their beliefs. This includes six communities – Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians. An important point to be noted here in that Muslims are not included in this list because they do not come under the minorities facing persecution for their beliefs. The fortune of the bill is yet to be decided and one should hope that if implemented it should give proper returns to India’s plans without compromising National Security.",
      "@Ramesh,Assam is still a bigger state than Tripura.The most affected people are from Tripura a very tiny state where locals already become minority in last 70 years due to hindu and buddhist influx from bangladesh. Assam is upset because people from bangladesh are coming over for many reasons..better life,works etc.Now majority of Indian don't want to recognise the ethnicity of NE states as fellow Indian with respect and dignity,how on earth a Gujarati(whether Modi or Amita shah) will recognise whereas their main intention is to be an agent of Gujarati businessman? In a country of 1.3 Billion population,300 million muslims are considered as minority,so what kind of minority the NE people will be considered? Total indigenous population of NE will be hardly 30 to 40 million.However,when govt can’t provide jobs to its own citizen,where 70% live under poverty level,instead of skill imports India is implementing laws to import the poor from highly conflicted countries.Their mental health condition is also highly vulnerable when they come to india due to executions. My personal thoughts, this is a brainless approach with very low calibre people in govt.I really don't blame politicians(considering many\nof them not well educated) but the policy makers.\nTwo days back some students from Tripura went to protest,a group of bengali(bangladeshi origins) came with police support vandalised a\nmarket areas and police shot 6 boys who were protesting the bill peacefully.Absolutely nonsensical.The bill is not even good for the bengalis either whose ancestors were bangladeshi once. Sad day for the entire NE communities",
      "The problem is, Assam is a state and Bangladesh is a country and Area of Bangladesh is 1,47,570 sq-kms and Assam’s 78,438 sq-kms, Almost half. Assam is a state where majority of the people are dependent on cultivation and many people belonging to BPL are working for meager wages. On the other hand, Bangladeshi miyas are always looking for such kind of jobs to survive and that’s how they end up entering Assam. The clear point is- The area Assam holds, that much of land is not enough for us Assamese ourselves to build houses and to cultivate, let alone giving it away to some refugees. Moreover, if Bangladeshis are allowed to stay in Assam legally, their population will outnumber our Assamese population for sure in no time, which will wipe out the culture and identity of Assamese people and that’s what we are mostly concerned about. Central govt has no idea what Assam is going through, they don’t even care if Assam suffers or lives. For them Assam is a magical place that pops up only during the election time, otherwise it is land of \nlooking people for them. They are trying to create a solid vote bank by providing shelter to the immigrants which is a threat and a relief at the same time for them and of course will be very beneficial for the ruling govt. We are Assamese, and Assam is our land. No fucking govt. has any right to use it for a political deal without the consent/permission of people who bleed Assam. It is about our Identity and dignity, any forceful move will lead to a war in this case. It’s a Bill, if passed will only bring disturbance and cause chaos all around. As an Assamese, I DON’T SUPPORT THIS BILL and REQUEST JPC TO RECONSIDER BEFORE PASSING IT FOR EVERYONE’s PROSPERITY.",
      "Yout answer is bullshit, you have half knowledge about this bill. This bill is not only for Assam but for whole India. I'm from Jaisalmer, rajasthan and here in Rajasthan there are many people living as emigrants who have thrown out from pakistan or treated badly in pakistan just because of they are\nHindus and the biggest Irony is India isn't giving them citizenship because of our constitutional restrictions. They dont have houses, they cant get jobs,they have nothing to eat because they dont have any identity. They are living with help of people around them. We feed them, we are give them food, they\nare also some NGOs who helped them much but apparently it would not possible to help them always. Govt. had to make or take some mazor steps, and it seems his time govt. has done that well. For sake of humanity please think they are human as well, we can live with them. Whatever is in our fate we'll get in our life, no matter how many people are there around. Thanks",
      "Assam citizens Assam citizenship bleed Assam wtf ….Assam is India and believe it or not u will bleed India always and u will remain Indian till the time u r alive and Ur future generations are alive.

      "Your writing is crystal clear. Thank you very much. Can you tell me why the BJP has now brought in the Bill, in an election year, when it knows the Bill will upset the people of Assam?"

      "Since the act makes provisions only for six communities from three countries and excludes Muslims, Jews, Atheists and others; and thus raises a question if\n it would violate the article 14 (right to equality and discrimination on the basis of religion). The larger implications of this bill would be in North East where most illegal Bangladeshi immigrants are Muslims. The Centre’s claim that the bill seeks to protect minorities facing religious persecution doesn’t cut ice. If that were indeed the case, why keep out Muslim minority Rohingyas from Myanmar? The message that goes out is that India is willing to provide shelter to all except Muslims. Plus, unlike Israel which offers a home to all the Jews of the world, India is a secular country. So the equation of citizenship with certain religions is\n prima facie unconstitutional. India needs a rational citizenship programme for refugees that operates on a case by case basis irrespective of religious\n denomination.",
      "I am against the bill because already India has population much more than it can afford and now if these foreigners gets citizenship then the economy of the country\nwill be unstable. There will be scarcity of food, which will lead to rise in prices of food as well as other household goods needed in our day to day life.\nThen to solve the problem of scarcity of food India will have to import them from other countries because I think in no way our country will be able to produce so much\nfood, even if all the farmers use advance farming techniques.\nSo, please I want to request everyone (don't worry I'll not ask you to upvote) to stand against the bill.",
      "Citizenship act 1955 defines Citizenship by naturalization that is - any persecuted Hindu, Sikh, Jain, Buddhist, parsi and Christians from bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan staying in India as a refugee for minimum of 12 years becomes a citizen of India.\n\nCitizenship ammendment bill, 2016- is the modification of the above bill which seeks to reduce the time limit to six years.But nowhere does it mention that the\npeople would be dumped in Assam.\nI personally is of the opinion that Assam or as a whole the entire north east which has such a heterogeneous population should not take any more people.\nIn fact even few months back Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh has given Citizenship to some 200 Hindu and Sikh families from Pakistan who stayed as refugees in India for\n the last 12 years.\nThe protests that are going in these days are unnecessary. These are being done to play with the emotions of Assamese people by so called intellectuals of Assam. Wait\ntill the final list of NRC is out. Everything will be clear."
