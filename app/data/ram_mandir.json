      "Shri Rama was an ideal king. He ruled the kingdom in a wonderful way. He was just and righteous. He was courageous and kind. He was endowed with a gentle and generous disposition. He was civil and courteous.\nTherefore His subjects loved Him immensely. Not a single man was unhappy during His regime. He often used to say, “I will do anything and everything to please My subjects; and, if necessary, I can even abandon My dear wife for their sake.” That is the reason why His reign was called “Rama Rajya.” There were not dacoits during His regime. All led a virtuous life. Nobody spoke any untruth. Anybody could place a bag of gold or jewels even in the main street. No one would touch it even.\nRama Rajya was based on truth. Dharma was its foundation. Shastras were the guiding principles. Rishis, Yogis, Munis and Brahma Jnanis were the guiding lights. The Vedas were respected and followed. Therefore, Rama Rajya endured and prospered. And it is even now spoken of as the most perfect form of government.\nnow we came across importance of ram mandir and ram rajya.\n",
      "I am Hindu born and brought up in UP, if you ask any Hindu about Ram Mandir, everyone wants mandir at disputed site.\nBefore coming to conclusion ,lets figure out the importance of Ram Mandir.\nLord Ram - A God, that too most beloved God for the followers of Sanatana Dharma (a.k.a Hindus, in your words).Ayodhya - A holy land, where Lord Shri Rama was born. He walked there, he lived there, he still lives there.Ram Mandir - A place of worship for the followers of Sanatana Dharma, with Lord Shri Rama as the presiding God.",
      "Definitely Yes! It should be Ram Temple on this land and there are no chance for any mosque as well as there are no chance of any temple at the main place of Makkah.But shameful politics and shameful laws are playing the role of very big obstacle to built the temple.\nPolitical parties are totally biased for Muslims because of vote bank like Congress,S.P.,B.S.P., and many others so called secular parties .They have not any courage for just saying anything in favour of the temple.",
      "Why not? Certainly, the Supreme Being, Lord Sri Ram is the symbol, sign, pure thoughts and soul of India. Bhagwaan Sri Ram, Gau Ganga and Gayatri are the symbol of Bharat. Without these above noted figures, there is no India anywhere. Certainly, A big Magnificent Lord Sri Ram temple must be built at the disputed site. Because, India is a land of Lord Sri Ram and Rishi Munis. Without Lord Sri Ram, there can not be India. That is why, there was very popular version once in several European countries that India is Lord Sri Ram and Lord Sri Ram is Indi",
      "Yes of course you should a build Ram Mandir but not in Ayodhya. First build it in your heart. Try to follow his path. He is the best. He is the greatest example how a person should be. He is a role model. He was the ideal son, ideal brother and a great king. He is the Maryada Purushottam.\nIf you have followed RAMAYANA in any form you must have noticed he just sacrificed his own things to others. I don't know how many of us will sacrifice our own things to our step mother or step brother or our own siblings. But he did, he gave up his own throne for the sake of his father's promise. Just like that, it doesn't mean he wasn't capable of conquer the throne, he had all the rights and most importantly he was the legal heir. Still he chose to go to forest for the sake of his father's words, for the sake of his step moms happiness. He wanted to go alone but his wife insisted to come and for the sake of dharma he had to take her along. His brother joined him again it was his choice. Ram never asked him to come along, he never forced his ideas/wishes on others be it on his wife be it on his brothers.",
      "NO\n*googled “problems in India”*\nResult:\nPoverty- Is this how you are planning to end poverty? By spending hundreds of crores of rupees in a building?Population growth- Is this how you are planning to end population growth? By killing hundreds of people in the riots afterwards?Employment- Is this how you are planning to generate employment? By giving the space for hundreds of people to beg?Corruption- Is this how you are planning to end corruption? By threatening the people of hell for performing such a sin?Gender Inequality- Is this how you are planning to end gender inequality? By not allowing the women to enter the holy place at that time of the month?Violence against women- Is this how you are planning to end the violence against women? By creating more Asharam Bapu?Reservation- Is this how you are planning to end caste system? By creating social inequalities inside the temple?Illiteracy- Is this how you are planning to end illiteracy? By teaching kids that we came from an angel sent by god?What are we fighting upon? We have a lot more, far important things to think.\nDon’t build the temple. Don’t build the mosque either. Build a school. At least those students will learn something and they will build a better India instead.",
      "The Ram Mandir at Ayodhya must be a stable achievement. A lasting symbol to the Hindu resolve and settlement of civilizational questions that face the Hindu nation. \nThose are the objectives rather than just the construction of a temple.\nThis means above all else a massive public education program that spans the entire length of breadth of India. A program that must last several decades and decisively transform the thinking of atleast three generations of India.\nThe building of the Ram Janmabhoomi must follow such a complete civilizational transformation of India, rather than be merely an incident of conflict with the muslims\nAfter the transformation of India, the muslims will no longer oppose this temple. They will rather gladly contribute to it and then become faithful devotees of Sri Ramachandra. That is the real objective of the Ramajanmabhoomi movement.",
      "Question asked: Should we build a Ram Mandir in Ayodhya?\nNo.\nThere. You see? If you are Indian, and a Hindu, you've already formed an opinion. An opinion that I'm a pseudo-secular liberal anti-national who should be sent to Pakistan.\nIf you have, don't waste your time. If you haven't, read on.\nThe demolition of the Babri Masjid on that fateful day was indeed an unfortunate incident, one that tore apart the secular credentials of India, the effects of which have been felt for a long time. There have been clamours to get a Ram temple built on its ruins ever since. There have been innumerable theories and refutations regarding the history of the place. Was there a temple? Was it demolished? Where are the artefacts?\nMy question is, does it matter? After all this time?\nTrue, it holds some historical, or at least mythological importance. But don't you think it's time to get over it? Stop acting like children crying over a sand castle on the beach ruined by your sibling?\nWe have a brilliant opportunity to do something for the community. The entire community. Not just Hindus or Muslims or Christians. We could build a school. Or a hospital. Maybe even a homeless shelter. One that helps in the betterments of all, and not just one community.\nCan a temple or a mosque achieve that? I don't think so.",
      "Ram Mandir Ayodhya mei banega.\nWhy?\nBecause preserving our ancient Hindu culture will make India a superpower. We don’t want to end up like parts of Africa which has fancy religious books in the hands but no food to eat.\nFood comes from knowledge and smartness. Knowledge comes from culture. We have one of the oldest culture that stood the test of time. We are taught to respect and love others. We are taught a Hindu way of living that made us the most tolerant religion in the world\nNow we are a free nation and our culture/religion should be preserved.\nLiberal - Do you want Rammandir or Jobs ?\nMe - A grand Ram Mandir in Ayodhya will provide thousands of jobs to people in there\nImagine the number of piligrims that will visit Ram lalla every year. It will become one more Kashi or Tirupati",
      "Yes, Ram Mandir should be build. First of all India is a Hindu country and India should not take any permission to make Hindu temples. India is Hindu because if you see history 100% of people are Hindu. Just because some Mughals attacked India and forcefully converted some Hindu, does not mean Hindu culture should decline. Hindus should do what they feel like. In Vedic era if a Brahmin says to build Temple, king do not have the power to deny order of Brahmin",
      "The emotions and feelings of about a billion people are just stones. No devotee is going to tolerate almost 6 decades , I guess. If I were a Hindu , I will happy to see Ram Mandir that reflects Hinduism and India indeed.\nHere , I just wanted to think just as them. And I do not want to take sides. I wish nothing but a fitting Supreme Court verdict that finds out a peaceful solution to this problem."
