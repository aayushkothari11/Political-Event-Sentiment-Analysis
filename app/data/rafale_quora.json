      "Like I said in the beginning  this isn’t a great deal for India because we purchased the aircraft at the time when we were in a state of urgency. Why we reached here is a question worth asking, and I think the UPA government’s delay has it’s own share in the current state of affairs.I’ve been a part of commercial negotiations as a part of my job, and have also evaluated various purchase deals. Here is what I feel:In most cases, timing matters more than you think. Non-availability of something is a much bigger risk than that thing being costly. Therefore, the deal of buying 36 aircraft looks logical.Indecisiveness is a big negative point. Various people in purchase deals don’t take a decision and then start pointing fingers towards the people who take a decision. This is a coward’s job. A purchase manager who didn’t buy the item does not later get to tell his successor that he would have bought at a lower cost. UPA government acted indecisive. And that’s not acceptable.About choosing the offset partners, here is the thing: nothing happens over night. Something must have been discussed and settled about who the offset partners should be. I cannot for the life of me believe that in such a huge deal - India’s largest defense contract - nobody tried to earn money under the table. It’s obvious, it happens, and it might have happened.However, such a thing cannot be proved. Therefore, to keep repeating it makes no sense. I cannot make an allegation. Notice that in my answer I simply expressed that the chances of some scandal are higher than the chances of a clean deal. But we have to live with it. Keep guessing, but don’t act of mere feelings.And lastly, it is not significant. I don’t say that corruption is insignificant or unimportant. I am simply saying that this deal doesn’t appear to be so fishy. The profiteering, if any, is nowhere as close as Rahul Gandhi keeps mentioning.",
      "Rahul Gandhi can very well attack Modi government over employement issues or about farmer distress or even about press freedom. But he is instead trying to create an imaginary scam and making a fool of himself.",
      "My views on the Rafale deal are that it is not transparent deal. It is against the fair public procurement policy. It smells of favouritism.Even a kid knows that when the government wants to purchase something from public funds, they have to invite competitive bidding so that thr country ends up buying at lowest prices. It is fundamental right of you to participate in government tenders. If the tender is a global, it is also your fundamental right to form the consortium with foreign partner and participate in the domestic tender. Let us acknowledge that the present government wanted to promote  Make In India program in that the holder of some patented technology need to set up manufacturing facilities in India so that not only foreign investment is promoted but also the purpose is served.",
      "Lets look into facts you will be surprisedFollow me to get updated on defence related informationsRafale deal initiated by upa was 126 rafales with 550crores for each well this deal didn't include weapons package,storm shadow nuclear cruise missiles and meteor air to air missiles or Israeli helmet mounted displays.And the main thing dassault didn't agree to the praising put forward by upa government which led to delays in price negotiations and scrapping of the agreement by ndaAnd dassault was also not ready to manufacture jets in india with hal due to quality issues.During this period the cost of jets significantly increasedNow let's look at modi led nda government deal:First of all rafale was a wrong choice though the specification s of the fighter are superb the cost of jets were high to replace keeping the funds of indian airforce in mind bcoz airforce needed a plane to replace all 250mig27 and mig23 aircrafts and fill up the medium multirole jets requirementsRealising this the Modi government renegotiated the dealThe cost of entire 36 aircraft was 3.5 billion dollarsweapons package along with meteor air to air missiles and storm shadow ground attack missile,scalp nuclearnuclear cruise missiles along with five years maintainance guarantee and supply chain cost 2.5 billionAnd that was reason each jet cost 1550 crores including weapons package and offset clause it was mentionedAnd three billion will be invested as offset clause one billion by saffron or snecma in kaveri engine 800 million by dassault in building a industrial park and remaining amount by subsystem manufacturers to develop an aerospace industry in india.Congress is talking about a deal which never took place.The government is not able to disclose exact prices bcoz of the pact signed by india and France in 2008 during a.k antonys tenure as defence ministry of defence have released a press release today with the copy of the agreement.Hope you got all information regarding the Rafale deal",
      "From the upvotes received by answers which suggest that everything is clean in Rafale deal I gather that a majority of people reading the answer on quora believe that Modi government is clean on the issue. This is sad because if Modi government is clean then it should answer the questions raised in the parliament & by Sinha, Shourie & Prashant. I am convinced that Modi does not have the answers to the questions & there is definitely a scam.",
      "There is no corruption involved in Rafael deal. No corruption will be allowed to creep into it by Modi. It is a government to government deal where middlemen have no place. So the deal is between government and the proceed goes to French government. There is no scope for corruption. If this basic thing cannot be understood by a leader who wants to become the PM of this great nation, he is nothing but a fool.I am surely going to vote Modi, because he has given the best administration and is making India strong.",
      "A better insight of this deal can only be provided by the defence ministry or the authorities associated with the deal . Instead of moving into a conclusion and spreading unwanted myths. Air Chief Marshal stated that the fact is completely false and said they got a better deal than the previous deal with improved machinery and weaponry . But I am not sure if this is true . Congress claims that BJP is purchasing these jets at much higher rate . The price of each and every item fluctuates from day To day . For example if the price of Dal was ₹50 /- 5 years ago . Now it has reached UpTo ₹150-₹200 . Which is almost 3–4 times than the previous price . So in this I expect the price to be a bit high . If Rahul was so cautious about tax payers hard earned money then they could have finalised the deal in previous years during UPA government .If congress were with this mindset 4 years ago . Then there wouldn't have been any scams during their period .",
      "I think the deal is brilliantly managed by the current Govt but since lot of common people don’t know much about this in detail they are being taken for ride by opposition parties.",
      "If one's raising a question on the Rafale deal and there are so many voices coming up then they should be pay heed to as I believe it's important.\nBut the thing is no one wants to probe Rafale for the fact that it'll bring out if there are any wrongdoings .Opposition wants to raise it only to spread hate against Modi and want to bring him down at any cost . They are least concerned about the country.\nI myself support probing of Rafale deal . But one can't adhere to the demands of the opposition to disclose the price of the Rafale aircrafts and the other confidential information subjected to the secrecy clause.\nLet there be a Free and Fair probe which should be under the watch of the Supreme Court of India .\nBut the problem is even if the SC gives a judgement in favour of the Govt , the opposition says that Govt has misused it's power.\nThe same is with the BJP. The parties support the SC judgements as per their political needs.\nOne has to agree the opposition parties don't have any faith in the Constitutional Institutions.\nThe BJP might not support some judgements of SC but still those are very less instances than we see as compared to the opposition.\nAnd whatever anyone says\nNarendra Modi is a very great , honest and Inspirational leader. One can hate BJP , but not this amazing and great Man.\nYes , BJP has leaders which don't deserve to be there but that's something which will require quiet a time to change unfortunately\nEdit: Now that the Supreme Court has dismissed all the petitions there's no need for any probe",
      "One point I wanted to mention, the offset clause does not say that the offset partners will manufacture parts of the Rafales. Actually, they can manufacture and supply any parts for Dassault's product line. In this particular case, the Rafale fighters are being bought in fly-away condition, i.e. complete fighter jet will be flown from France to India, completely manufactured by Dassault. The offset partners will supply parts to other Dassault products, but not for Rafale"
